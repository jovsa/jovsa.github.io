## Theory

Cold Open: Why the audience should care

Act 1: Setup: Contextualize and hook me till the end

* We are going take 24 hours and try to meet YesTheory.
* Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pill of water.

Act 2: The conflict. Take me though the adventure

* We are going to try multiple different ways get to them and fail. All the way till the end, it's unsure if we are going to succeed.
* Jack fell down and broke his crown.

Act 3: The resolution:  Release the tension from Act 2.

* Meet YesTheory and everything is great.
* Jill came tumbling after.

Outro: Restate what the audience learned but more importantly, call to action.

* Like and subscribe

Notes:

* Each act has to have a clear ending and the we have to signify it to the audience. Usually put the thing in text on the screen.
* Tension/Stakes has to always be rising until *Act 3: the resolution*.
* Transition can have the following purpose:
  * Transitional
  * Show the audience a broader perspective and where they are in time.

Rough notes:

Cold Open: X Is not worth it
Act 1:

* This thread is long, but here is the main takeaway
* SCQ: or S [a few YESes], Complication is the main one... and then jump directly to the Proposition

---
Peter Theil Debate:
* Challange the problem or reframe it
* Refrance the problem as "what" and "how" `calibrated questions`.
* Talk about complication. Everthing before this was `situation`.
* Propose a Question or state the solution and walk them though.

What is a short story?
* It's all about that specific fix

* Structure:
  * Milieu
    * `starts` when chaterter enters a place. `Ends` when character leaves a place.
    * Anything that prevents the character from leaving the place is **conflict**.
  * Inquiry:
    * `starts` Aroo? . Ends `Aha`!
    * Conflict = Anyting that add more confusion
  * Character
    * Starts from a sad point in a character. `Ends` when the character find peace.
    * This is more an internal conflict.
  * Event
    * Similar to `Character`, but here the conflict is external.
* You can nest `Structure`.
  * Wizard of oz `<C><E><M><I></I></M></E></C>`
  * You can even close a story that you haven't started yet. Ex. Lord of the Rings.
* Detials:
  * Who: What is the user doing?
  * Where: The user wants to know where they are. So add some sensory details.
