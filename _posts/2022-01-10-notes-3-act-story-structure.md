## Theory

Cold Open: Why the audience should care

Act 1: Setup: Contextualize and hook me till the end

* We are going take 24 hours and try to meet YesTheory.
* Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pill of water.

Act 2: The conflict. Take me though the adventure

* We are going to try multiple different ways get to them and fail. All the way till the end, it's unsure if we are going to succeed.
* Jack fell down and broke his crown.

Act 3: The resolution:  Release the tension from Act 2.

* Meet YesTheory and everything is great.
* Jill came tumbling after.

Outro: Restate what the audience learned but more importantly, call to action.

* Like and subscribe

Notes:

* Each act has to have a clear ending and the we have to signify it to the audience. Usually put the thing in text on the screen.
* Tension/Stakes has to always be rising until *Act 3: the resolution*.
* Transition can have the following purpose:
  * Transitional
  * Show the audience a broader perspective and where they are in time.

Rough notes:

Cold Open: X Is not worth it
Act 1:

* This thread is long, but here is the main takeaway
* SCQ: or S [a few YESes], Complication is the main one... and then jump directly to the Proposition

Peter Theil Debate:
* Challange the problem or reframe it
* Reframe the problem as "what" and "how" `calibrated questions`.
* Talk about complication. Everthing before this was `situation`.
* Propose a Question.
  * What would it take to make television feel like superbowl ever day? [Shishir](https://youtu.be/lbfu6u0EIOE?t=1102)
* State the solution and walk them though. Should be a pitty twitter quote

Chamath

* hook = catchphrase or short story
* How it extend to our world (or the problem that you are trying to solve).
  * Keep on extending on multiple cases.
* Key insight:
  * How this relates to key players
  * This is the "first" step in something bigger
* Examples
* Counter Example
* Restate insight
* How this is usefull to think.

* [public speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8GvTgWtR7o)
  * Engaging with the audience: you think X, but guess what?
    * Provocative question: You think this? Well, guess what

  * [5 Psychological Tricks To Win Any Argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGACRHlzwx8)

* start with agreement
* Build rapor
* Snuk premise
* Reframe the problem away from the personal
  * don't use "it seem like"
  * ask, image if you could, or what you are doing

Kevin P.

* [Becoming President.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDIHQ8tbmP0&t)
* The problem: create fear (or finding fear) or find HOPE
  * Not doing x is fear of y
* A representation of the fear: Find a scapegoat
  * The reason why y-fear or hope does not exist
* Find conformity (sign of where people can look): Those who support you, can visually see conformity
  * Visual symbols needed
* Show how you/solution is the only way to solve the original problem
  * use short buzzword phrases

What is a short story?
* It's all about that specific fix

* Structure (Mice Threads):
  * Milieu
    * `starts` when chaterter enters a place. `Ends` when character leaves a place.
    * Anything that prevents the character from leaving the place is **conflict**.
  * Inquiry:
    * `starts` Aroo? . Ends `Aha`!
    * Conflict = Anyting that add more confusion
  * Character
    * Starts from a sad point in a character. `Ends` when the character find peace.
    * This is more an internal conflict.
  * Event
    * Similar to `Character`, but here the conflict is external.
    * Change the status quo.
* You can nest `Structure`.
  * Wizard of oz `<C><E><M><I></I></M></E></C>`
  * You can even close a story that you haven't started yet. Ex. Lord of the Rings.
* How to start:
  * Who: What is the user doing? or some reflection.
  * Where: The user wants to know where they are. So add some sensory details.
* Size:
  * $$L = \frac{(C+S)750*M}{1.5} $$
  * where:
    * L = Length of story
    * C = Characters
    * S = Stage
    * M = Mice Threads
* Conflict
  * Try and Fail cycle
    * Yes, but (going forward); No, and (going backward).
* Resolution
  * Start solving in the 3/4 mark.
  * Yes and, No but.
* Sanderson Pyramid of abstrction:
  Ground with concrete then go up.
