## Notes

### Letters to the Shareholders

#### 1997: It's all about the long term

```
“We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.

Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies.”

```

* `It’s All About the Long Term`.
    * Play in fields that are growing
    * Focus relentessly on cusotmers.
    * Give more weight to long term decisions.
    * Make bold decisions that provide sufficient prob. of gaining market leadership.
    * Plan for some of your bold decisions not playing out, but the ones that do shold cover the cost.
    * Choose maximizing FCF over GAAP metrics.
    * Share your strategic thought process (as mush as competition allows) to ensure you are getting feedback and making long-term leadership investments.
    * Keep lean, enforce a cost-concious culture.
    * Balance focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. Also ok to pick one for a perticular period and see-saw.
    * Hire the best and pay in equity.
* Bring on shareholders who align with your values

#### 1998: Obsessions
* Stay terrified of your customers
* If you’re expending effort trying to follow your rivals’ every move, you’re losing the big picture. Ex. using PE to attact investments but loosing in the end (ex. fast food industry).
* Questions as your hire
    * Will you admire this person?
    * Will this person raise the average level of effectiveness of ht group they're entering?
    * Along what dimention might this person be a superstar?

#### 1999: Building for the long term
* $2B in annulized sales
    * $0.22B in inventory
    * $0.318B in fixed assets
    * $0.062B in operating cash over 5 years
* "I have one hundred shares of Amazon. What do I own?"
* Growth in the both the number of our customers and the strength of the relationship we have with each of them and growing our relationships with partners.
* Build on top of infrastructure that's improving on it's own
