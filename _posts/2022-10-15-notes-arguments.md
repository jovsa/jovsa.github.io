### Operations

* Negation: `~`
* OR/Disjunction (inclusive): `v`
* XOR (exclusive):
* AND/Conjunction: `^`
* Conditional: `P=>Q`; `P` is the antecedent, `Q` is the consequent
* Bi-conditional (if and only if): `P<=>Q`; `P` is the antecedent, `Q` is the consequent

### Truth Tables

### Replacement Rules

> Used to replace one expression with another.

* Double Negation: `P <=> ~~P`
* Material Implication: `P=>Q <=> ~PvQ`
  * Helps convert conditionals to disjunctions
* Contraposition: `P=>Q <=> ~Q=>~P`
  * Helps convert conditionals to conditionals
* De Morgan's Law: `~(P^Q) <=> ~Pv~Q`
  * Helps convert conjunctions to disjunctions
* Associativity:
  * with conjunction: `(P^Q)^R <=> P^(Q^R)`
  * with disjunction: `(PvQ)vR <=> Pv(QvR)`
* Commutativity
* Distribution
  * with conjunction: `P^(QvR) <=> (P^Q)v(P^R)`
  * with disjunction: `Pv(Q^R) <=> (PvQ)^(PvR)`
* Idempotence
  * with conjunction: `P^P <=> P`
  * with disjunction: `PvP <=> P`

### Rules of Inference

> Help us draw conclusions from premises

* Modus Ponens:
  1. `P=>Q`
  2. `P`
  3. `therefore Q`
* Modus Tollens:
  1. `P=>Q`
  2. `~Q`
  3. `therefore ~P`
* Disjunctive Syllogism:
  1. `PvQ`
  2. `~P`
  3. `therefore Q`
* Hypothetical Syllogism:
  1. `P=>Q`
  2. `Q=>R`
  3. `therefore P=>R`
* Dilemma:
  * Constructive:
    1. `P=>Q`
    2. `R=>S`
    3. `PvR`
    4. `therefore QvS`
  * Destructive:
    1. `P=>Q`
    2. `R=>S`
    3. `~Qv~S`
    4. `therefore ~Pv~R`
* Conjuction introduction
  1. `P`
  2. `Q`
  3. `therefore P^Q`
* Simplification
  1. `P^Q`
  2. `therefore P`
* Biconditional:
  * Biconditional elimination
    1. `P<=>Q`
    2. `therefore P=>Q` and `therefore Q=>P`
  * Biconditional introduction
    1. `P=>Q`
    2. `Q=>P`
    3. `therefore P<=>Q`
* Disjuction introduction
  1. `P`
  2. `therefore PvQ`

### Proofs

* Styles:
  * Proof by contradiction
  * Conditional proofs
  * Tautologies
  * Nested Proofs
  * Biconditional tautologies

* Proof strategy:
  1. DeMorgan's Everything
  2. Working backwards
  3. Proof by cases


### Fallacies

* Affirming the consequent
* Denying the antecedent
