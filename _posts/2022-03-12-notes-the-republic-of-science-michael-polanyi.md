My title is intended to suggest that the community of scientists is organized in a way which resembles certain features
of a body politic and works according to economic principles similar to those by which the production of material
goods is regulated. Much of what I will have to say will be common knowledge among scientists, but I believe that it
will recast the subject from a novel point of view which can both profit from and have a lesson for political and
economic theory. For in the free cooperation of independent scientists we shall find a highly simplified model of a free
society, which presents in isolation certain basic features of it that are more difficult to identify within the
comprehensive functions of a national body.

The first thing to make clear is that scientists, freely making their own choice of problems and pursuing them in the
light of their own personal judgment, are in fact co-operating as members of a closely knit organization. The point can
be settled by considering the opposite case where individuals are engaged in a joint task without being in any way co-
ordinated. A group of women shelling peas work at the same task, but their individual efforts are not co-ordinated. The
same is true of a team of chess players. This is shown by the fact that the total amount of peas shelled and the total
number of games won will not be affected if the members of the group are isolated from each other. Consider by
contrast the effect which a complete isolation of scientists would have on the progress of science. Each scientist would
go on for a while developing problems derived from the information initially available to all. But these problems would
soon be exhausted, and in the absence of further information about the results achieved by others, new problems of any
value would cease to arise, and scientific progress would come to a standstill.
This shows that the activities of scientists are in fact coordinated, and it also reveals the principle of their co-ordination.
This consists in the adjustment of the efforts of each to the hitherto achieved results of the others. We may call this a
coordination by mutual adjustment of independent initiatives--of initiatives which are co-ordinated because each takes
into account all the other initiatives operating within the same system.

---

When put in these abstract terms the principle of spontaneous coordination of independent initiatives may sound
obscure. So let me illustrate it by a simple example. Imagine that we are given the pieces of a very large jigsaw puzzle,
and suppose that for some reason it is important that our giant puzzle be put together in the shortest possible time. We
would naturally try to speed this up by engaging a number of helpers; the question is in what manner these could be
best employed. Suppose we share out the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle equally among the helpers and let each of them
work on his lot separately. It is easy to see that this method, which would be quite appropriate to a number of women
shelling peas, would be totally ineffectual in this case, since few of the pieces allocated to one particular assistant
would be found to fit together. We could do a little better by providing duplicates of all the pieces to each helper
separately, and eventually somehow bring together their several results. But even by this method the team would not
much surpass the performance of a single individual at his best. The only way the assistants can effectively co-operate,
and surpass by far what any single one of them could do, is to 1et them work on putting the puzzle together in sight of
the others so that every time a piece of it is fitted in by one helper, all the others will immediately watch out for the next
step that becomes possible in consequence. Under this system, each helper will act on his own initiative, by responding
to the latest achievements the others, and the completion of their joint task will be great accelerated. We have here in a
nutshell the way in which a series of independent initiatives are organized to a joint achievement by mutually adjusting
themselves at every successive stage to the situation created by all the others who are acting likewise.
Such self-co-ordination of independent initiatives leads to a joint result which is unpremeditated by any of those who
bring it about. Their co-ordination is guided as by 'an invisible hand' towards the joint discovery of a hidden system of
things. Since its end-result is unknown, this kind of co-operation can only advance stepwise, and the total performance
will be the best possible if each consecutive step is decided upon by the person most competent to do so. We may
imagine this condition to be fulfilled for the fitting together of a jigsaw puzzle if each helper watches out for any new
opportunities arising along a particular section of the hitherto completed patch of the puzzle, and also keeps an eye on a
particular lot of pieces, so as to fit them in wherever a chance presents itself. The effectiveness of a group of helpers
will then exceed that of any isolated member, to the extent to which some member of the group will always discover a
new chance for adding a piece to the puzzle more quickly than any one isolated person could have done by himself.

Any attempt to organize the group of helpers under a single authority would eliminate their independent initiatives and
thus reduce their joint effectiveness to that of the single person directing them from the centre. It would, in effect,
paralyse their cooperation.
Essentially the same is true for the advancement of science by independent initiatives adjusting themselves
consecutively to the results achieved by all the others. So long as each scientist keeps making the best contribution of
which he is capable, and on which no one could improve (except by abandoning the problem of his own choice and
thus causing an overall loss to the advancement of science), we may affirm that the pursuit of science by independent
self-co-ordinated initiatives assures the most efficient possible organization of scientific progress. And we may add,
again, that any authority which would undertake to direct the work of the scientist centrally would bring the progress of
science virtually to a standstill.

What I have said here about the highest possible co-ordination of individual scientific efforts by a process of self-co-
ordination may recall the self-co-ordination achieved by producers and consumers operating in a market. It was,
indeed, with this in mind that I spoke of 'the invisible hand' guiding the co-ordination of independent initiatives to a
maximum advancement of science, just as Adam Smith invoked 'the invisible hand' to describe the achievement of
greatest joint material satisfaction when independent producers and consumers are guided by the prices of goods in a
market. I am suggesting, in fact, that the co-ordinating functions of the market are but a special case of co-ordination by
mutual adjustment. In the case of science, adjustment takes place by taking note of the published results of other
scientists; while in the case of the market, mutual adjustment is mediated by a system of prices broadcasting current
exchange relations, which make supply meet demand.
But the system of prices ruling the market not only transmits information in the light of which economic agents can
mutually adjust their actions, it also provides them with an incentive to exercise economy in terms of money. We shall
see that, by contrast, the scientist responding directly to the intellectual situation created by the published results of
other scientists is motivated by current professional standards.
Yet in a wider sense of the term, the decisions of a scientist choosing a problem and pursuing it to the exclusion of
other possible avenues of inquiry may be said to have an economic character. For his decisions are designed to produce
the highest possible result by the use of a limited stock of intellectual and material resources. The scientist fulfils this
purpose by choosing a problem that is neither too hard nor too easy for him. For to apply himself to a problem that does
not tax his faculties to the full is to waste some of his faculties; while to attack a problem that is too hard for him would
waste his faculties altogether. The psychologist K. Lewin has observed that one's person never becomes fully involved
either in a problem that is much too hard, nor in one that is much too easy. The line the scientist must choose turns out,
therefore, to be that of greatest ego-involvement; it is the line of greatest excitement, sustaining the most intense
attention and effort of thought. The choice will be conditioned to some extent by the resources available to the scientist
in terms of materials and assistants, but he will be ill-advised to choose his, problem with a view to guaranteeing that
none of these resource be wasted. He should not hesitate to incur such a loss, if it leads him to deeper and more
important problems.

---

This is where professional standards enter into the scientist's motivation. He assesses the depth of a problem and the
importance of its prospective solution primarily by the standards of scientific merit accepted by the scientific
community--though his own work may demand these standards to be modified. Scientific merit depends on a number
of criteria which I shall enumerate here under three headings. These criteria are not altogether independent of each
other, but I cannot analyse here their mutual relationship.
(1) The first criterion that a contribution to science must fulfil in order to be accepted is a sufficient degree of
plausibility. Scientific publications are continuously beset by cranks, frauds and bunglers whose contributions must be
rejected if journals are not to be swamped by them. This censorship will not only eliminate obvious absurdities but
must often refuse publication merely because the conclusions of a paper appear to be unsound in the light of current
scientific knowledge. It is indeed difficult even to start an experimental inquiry if its problem is considered
scientifically unsound. Few laboratories would accept today a student of extrasensory perception, and even a project for
testing once more the hereditary transmission of acquired characters would be severely discouraged from the start.
Besides, even when all these obstacles have been overcome, and a paper has come out signed by an author of high
distinction in science, it may be totally disregarded, simply for the reason that its results conflict sharply with the
current scientific opinion about the nature of things.

I shall illustrate this by an example which I have used elsewhere.[1] A series of simple experiments were published in
June 1947 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society by Lord Rayleigh--a distinguished Fellow of the Society--purporting
to show that hydrogen atoms striking a metal wire transmit to it energies up to a hundred electron volts. This, if true,
would have been far more revolutionary than the discovery of atomic fission by Otto Hahn. Yet, when I asked
physicists what they thought about it, they only shrugged their shoulders. They could not find fault with the experiment
yet not one believed in its results, nor thought it worth while to repeat it. They just ignored it. A possible explanation of
Lord Rayleigh's experiments is given in my Personal Knowledge.[2] It appears that the physicists missed nothing by
disregarding these findings.
(2) The second criterion by which the merit of a contribution is assessed may be described as its scientific value, a
value that is composed of the following three coefficients: (a) its accuracy (b) its systematic importance, (c) the
intrinsic interest of its subject-matter. You can see these three gradings entering jointly into the value of a paper in
physics compared with one in biology. The inanimate things studied by physics are much less interesting than the
living beings which are the subject of biology. But physics makes up by its great accuracy and wide theoretical scope
for the dullness of its subject, while biology compensates for its lack or accuracy and theoretical beauty by its exciting
matter.
(3) A contribution of sufficient plausibility and of a given scientific value may yet vary in respect of its originality; this
is the third criterion of scientific merit. The originality of technical inventions is assessed, for the purpose of claiming a
patent, in terms of the degree of surprise which the invention would cause among those familiar with the art. Similarly,
the originality of a discovery is assessed by the degree of surprise which its communication should arouse among
scientists. The unexpectedness of a discovery will overlap with its systematic importance, yet the surprise caused by a
discovery, which causes us to admire its daring and ingenuity, is something different from this. It pertains to the act of
producing the discovery. There are discoveries of the highest daring and ingenuity, as for example the discovery of
Neptune, which have no great systematic importance.

---

Both the criteria of plausibility and of scientific value tend to enforce conformity, while the value attached to
originality encourages dissent. This internal tension is essential in guiding and motivating scientific work. The
professional standards of science must impose a framework of discipline and at the same time encourage rebellion
against it. They must demand that, in order to be taken seriously, an investigation should largely conform to the
currently predominant beliefs about the nature of things, while allowing that in order to be original it may to some
extent go against these. Thus, the authority of scientific opinion enforces the teachings of science in general, for the
very purpose of fostering their subversion in particular points.
This dual function of professional standards in science is but the logical outcome of the belief that scientific truth is an
aspect of reality and that the orthodoxy of science is taught as a guide that should enable the novice eventually to make
his own contacts with this reality. The authority of scientific standards is thus exercised for the very purpose of
providing those guided by it with independent grounds for opposing it. The capacity to renew itself by evoking and
assimilating opposition to itself appears to be logically inherent in the sources of the authority wielded by scientific
orthodoxy.
But who is it, exactly, who exercises the authority of this orthodoxy? I have mentioned scientific opinion as its agent.
But this raises a serious problem. No single scientist has a sound understanding of more than a tiny fraction of the total
domain of science. How can an aggregate of such specialists possibly form a joint opinion? How can they possibly
exercise jointly the delicate function of imposing a current scientific view about the nature of things, and the current
scientific valuation of proposed contributions, even while encouraging an originality which would modify this
orthodoxy? In seeking the answer to this question we shall discover yet another organizational principle that is essential
for the control of a multitude of independent scientific initiatives. This principle is based on the fact that, while
scientists can admittedly exercise competent judgment only over a small part of science, they can usually judge an area
adjoining their own special studies that is broad enough to include some fields on which other scientists have
specialized. We thus have a considerable degree of overlapping between the areas over which a scientist can exercise a
sound critical judgment. And, of course, each scientist who is a member of a group of overlapping competences will
also be a member of other groups of the same kind, so that the whole of science will be covered by chains and networks
of overlapping neighbourhoods. Each link in these chains and networks will establish agreement between the
valuations made by scientists overlooking the same overlapping fields, and so, from one overlapping neighbourhood to
the other, agreement will be established on the valuation of scientific merit throughout all the domains of science.
Indeed, through these overlapping neighbourhoods uniform standards of scientific merit will prevail over the entire
range of science, all the way from astronomy to medicine. This network is the seat of scientific opinion. Scientific
