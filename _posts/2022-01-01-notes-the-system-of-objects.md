## Introduction

* In the strict sense, what happens to the object in the technological sphere is *essential*, whereas  what happens to it in the psycological or sociological sphere of needs and practises is *inessential*.
* Ultemately, the progression from abstract to concrete means that the technical object will tend towward he state of the system that is compleatly internally consistent and completly unified.
* It is quite possible to envision a science of structural technology working at this level that would stufy the organization of such technemes into more complex technical objects. The science could be stricly applied, however, only to a limited number of areas, ranging from ....These are precisely the areas where technical pressures maximize structural constraints, where the collective and impersoanal nature of products reduce their effectsof fashion to a minimum.
  * Whereas car makers must contunually explore every consivable variation in the form of their product, while meeting a very few basic technological requirements, aircraft manufacturers are obligated to product technical objects on the basis of simple functional imperitive.
  * Hence, if we want to account for the system of *everyday objects*, a structural technological analysis is clearly inadequate.
* For technology, unlike language, does not constitude a stable system.

## The functional system, or objective discourse

### Structres of Interior Design

* Human beings and objects are bound together in a certain density, an emotional value -  called *presense*. What gives the houses of our childhood such depth and resonance in memory is clearly this complex structure of interiority,and the objects within it serve for us as boundary markers of the symbolic configuration known as home.
* In their anthropomorphism the objects that furnish it become household gods, spatial incarnations of the emotional bonds and the permanence of the family group. These gods enjoyed a gentle immortality until the advent of a modern generation which has cast them aside, dispersed them - even, on occasion, reinstated them in an up-to-date nostalgia for whatever is old.
  * As often with gods, furniture too thus gets a second chance to exist, and passes from a na√Øve utility into a cultural baroque.

#### The modern object liberated in its function

* As long as the obect is liberated only in its function, man equally is liberated only as a user of that object.
* Somewhere between the two, the gap between integrated psycological scace and fragmated functional space, serial objects have their being, wirness to both the one and the other - sometimes within a single interior.

#### The model interior

* Modular components
  * The model interior happen at a privilaged level.
  * The models of the home funrnishing avant-garde are organized around the basic distinction between `components` and `seating`; the practical that obey the *interior design* and to the general concepts of *atmosphere*.
  * The value this relationship takes on is no longer of an instinctive or a psychological but, rather, of a tactical kind. What such objects embody is no longer the secret of a unique relationship but, rather, differences, and moves in a game.
* Walls and daylight
* lighting
* mirrors and portraits
* clocks and time
  * There is nothing in the world more reassuring.
  * The clock is a mechanical heart that reassures us about our own heart. It is precisely this process of infusion or assimilation of the substance of time, this presence of duration, which is rejected, just like all other returns to inwardness, by a modern order based on externality, spatiality and objective relationships.

#### Towards a sociology of interior design?

* Today, value resides neither in appropriation nor in intimacy but in information, in inventiveness, in control, in a continual openness to objective messages - in short, in the syntagmatic calculation which is, strictly speaking, the foundation of the discourse of the modern home-dweller.
* Advertising widely promotes this new conception of decoration: it is no longer a matter of setting up a theatre of objects or creating an ambience, but of solving a problem, devising the subtlest possible response to a complicated set of conditions, mobilizing a space.

#### Man the interior designer

* We are beginning to see what the new model of the home-dweller looks like: 'man the interior designer' is neither an owner nor a mere user - rather, he is an active engineer of atmosphere.
* Instead of consuming objects, he dominates, controls and orders them. He discovers himself in the manipulation and tactical equilibration of a system.
* Our environment, however, is a directly experienced model of existence, and it is very abstract indeed to apply to it computational and informational models borrowed from the purely technical realm - 'to your own taste', 'to your own measurements', 'personalization', 'the atmosphere will be yours alone'.
* Everything has to intercommunicate, everything has to be functional - no more secrets, no more mysteries, everything is organized, therefore everything is clear. Here we have the basis for a character profile of technical civilization: if hypochondria is an obsession with the circulation of substances and the functioning of the primary organs, we might well describe modern man, the cybernetician, as a mental hypochondriac, as someone obsessed with the perfect circulation of messages.

### Structres of Atmosphere

## The non-functional system, or subjective discourse

## The metafunctional and dysfunctional system

## The socio-ideological system of objects and their consuption

## Towards a definiation of consuption
