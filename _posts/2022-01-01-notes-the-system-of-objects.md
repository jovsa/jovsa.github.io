## Introduction

* In the strict sense, what happens to the object in the technological sphere is *essential*, whereas  what happens to it in the psycological or sociological sphere of needs and practises is *inessential*.
* Ultemately, the progression from abstract to concrete means that the technical object will tend towward he state of the system that is compleatly internally consistent and completly unified.
* It is quite possible to envision a science of structural technology working at this level that would stufy the organization of such technemes into more complex technical objects. The science could be stricly applied, however, only to a limited number of areas, ranging from ....These are precisely the areas where technical pressures maximize structural constraints, where the collective and impersoanal nature of products reduce their effectsof fashion to a minimum.
  * Whereas car makers must contunually explore every consivable variation in the form of their product, while meeting a very few basic technological requirements, aircraft manufacturers are obligated to product technical objects on the basis of simple functional imperitive.
  * Hence, if we want to account for the system of *everyday objects*, a structural technological analyssi is clearly inadequate.
