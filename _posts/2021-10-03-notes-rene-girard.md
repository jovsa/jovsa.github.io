## Mimetic Desire

* Content matters: Teaching, Rene realized that the stories in a lot of historical books were the same.
* Desire is always a borrowed thing - otherwise it would be called instinct (aka. "animal instinct or appetite"). Hence, human desire is changeable by it's very nature.
* "We learn because we want to be like the people from who we learn".
  * Any master and pupil are in the "double blind" situation.
  * You need to imitate something but not too effectively.
* When the resources are limited, this causes conflict.
* The closer we are, the more we want the same thing. The more we want the same thing (given that the same thing is limited), the more we compete.
  * Example: Shakeshpere, Aristotle
* Competition is inherint in imitation. Once it begins, it is self-sustaining. Because the conflict will be the main source of attraction. The competitor will become the main source of attraction. Ex. arguments as an everyday example, War is another brutal example. In other words, the point of fact that started the conflict is long forgot - scandal. The rivals grow alike with each attempt to be different. The is a reinforcing loop. However, the rivals only focus on the differences - `runaway immitation`.
* The self - Pushed by a collection of desires.
