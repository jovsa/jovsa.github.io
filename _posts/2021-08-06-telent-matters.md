Hook (TODO: tie to 5 second of transformation): Just hire the `really good` people and get out of the way. If it was that simple, why do so many fail to do it?

* I was recently talking to a colleague around what makes someone `good` at what they do.
* 1st Point of agreement: Independent, motived and more scope is better.
* 2nd Point of agreement:
* 3rd Point of agreement:
* However: Is it only scope? There is ample people who can build complex things, but are not that usefull.
* Q&A: Adding another dimension makes a world of difference


In an ideal world:

* When you start your career: you work on `E` (execution)
* Then you increase your scope
* Then you work on the `H` (How)
* Then you increase your scope
* Then you are given problems nad work on `S` (Solution).
* Then you increase scope.
* Lastly, you identify on `P` (Problem) or a Thesis


Complication: But what makes this hard?
  * This is non-linear - Most people get stuck in the `H->S` stage.
  * A lot of `P` involves taking bets and learning on your own.
  * It also requires to operate at a massive scope.

So why not just hire `really good` people and get out of the way?
5 second of transformation: You can, but you should have a system to take people up this ramp. It's better.
