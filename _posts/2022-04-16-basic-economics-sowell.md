## Discussion Questions

Notes: the page numbers indicated are from the 4th Edition.

### Prices and Markets (Ch. 1-4)

1. Can there be a growing scarcity without a growing shortage—or a growing shortage without a
growing scarcity? Explain with examples. (pgs. 49-51)

2. Can a decision be economic, if there is no money involved? Why or why not? (p. 6-7)

3. Can there be surplus food in a society where people are hungry? Explain why or why not? (pgs. 59-60)

4. When a housing shortage suddenly disappears, within a time period too short for any new housing to
have been built, and yet people no longer have any trouble finding a vacant home or apartment, what
has probably happened? What will probably happen in the longer run? Explain. (pgs. 41-42, 47)

5. Which of the following are—or are not—affected by price controls that limit how high the product’s
price can go: (a) the quantity supplied, (b) the quantity demanded, (c) the quality of the product, (d) a
black market for the product, (e) the supply of auxiliary services that usually go with the product, (f)
efficiency in the allocation of resources or (g) the average level of honesty among those who sell or rent
the product? Explain in each case.


A.) pgs. 43-47, B.) 41-43, C.) 56-58, D.) 54-56, E.) 52-54, F.) 44-45, 52, G.) 52-53, 64-65

6. Building ordinary housing and luxury housing involves using many of the same resources, such as
bricks, pipes, and construction labor. How does the allocation of these resources between ordinary
housing and luxury housing tend to change after rent control laws are passed? (pg. 45, 49)

7. Are prices usually higher or lower in low-income neighborhoods? Why? Include among prices the
interest rate on money borrowed and the cost of getting paychecks cashed. If you were considering
opening a business in a low-income neighborhood, would you expect to make a higher or a lower rate of
profit there than you would receive if you opened the same business in a middle-class or affluent
neighborhood?
Which kind of business is more likely to locate in each kind of neighborhood—a highly successful
supermarket chain or a small independent business run by recent immigrants with a limited knowledge
of English? Why would each kind of business tend to locate in one place but not the other? (pgs. 69-72)

8. When a government institution or program produces counterproductive results, is that a sign of
irrationality on the part of those who run that particular institution or program? Explain with examples.
(pgs. 73-74)


9. We all consider some things more important than others. Why then can there be a problem when
some official government policy establishes “national priorities?” (pgs. 84-85)

10. We tend to think of costs as the money we pay for things. But does that mean that there would be
no costs in a primitive society that did not yet use money or in a modern cooperative community, where
people collectively produce the goods and services they use and do not charge each other for them?
(pgs. 87-89)

11. Adam Smith had a high opinion of capitalism, despite his low opinion of capitalists. How does this
relate to the difference between systemic causation and intentional causation? (pg. 68-72)

12. Back in the days of the Soviet Union, the government owned and operated most of the enterprises
in the economy. Most prices were set by central planners, rather than by supply and demand, and the
success or failure of Soviet enterprises was judged primarily by how well they met the numerical targets
for production, which were set by the central planners. Specify five ways in which this arrangement
produced different economic end results from those in market economies. (pgs. 5, 17–18, 25–26, 29, 51,
54–55, 74)

13. How can the price of baseball bats be affected by the demand for paper or the price of catchers’
mitts be affected by the demand for cheese? (pgs. 21–22)

14. Why are price controls likely to cause more of a shortage of gasoline than of strawberries? (page 53)

15. How does rent control affect the quality of housing, the average age of housing, and the number of
people per apartment? (pgs. 42–43, 44–45)

### The Role of Profits—and Losses (Ch. 6)

1. Why has Toyota manufactured cars with only enough inventory of parts to last a few hours? Why did
Soviet industries have nearly enough inventory to last for a year? (pgs. 144-146)

2. Why is it that General Motors can make millions of automobiles, without making a single tire to go on
them, while Soviet enterprises not only tended to make all their own components, but sometimes even
made the bricks for the buildings in which they operated? (pgs. 143-144, 146-147)

3. How did diseconomies of scale in agriculture affect the way tractor drivers plowed fields in the Soviet
Union? What if agricultural enterprises had been privately owned and the tractor drivers were plowing
their own fields? Would the work have been done differently and would the farm likely to be as large?
Explain why. (pgs. 132-133)

4. Why do American manufacturers of computers or television sets tend to have them transported by
others while Chinese manufacturers tend to transport them themselves? (pgs. 144)

5. Advertising, even when it is successful, is often considered to be a benefit only to those who
advertise, but of no benefit to consumers, who have to pay the cost of advertisements in the higher
price of the products they buy. Evaluate this view from an economic perspective. (pg. 130, 573-578)

6. Why are retired people able to get much lower priced travel rates—on cruise ships, for example—
than most other people? Explain the economic reasons. (pg. 134-135)

7. Why is the perennial desire to “eliminate the middleman” perennially frustrated? (pgs. 139-143)

8. After the A&P grocery chain cut its profit margins on the goods it sold, back in the early twentieth
century, its rate of profit on its investment rose well above the national average. Why? (pg. 127)

9. Why would luxury hotels be charging lower rates than economy hotels in the same city? (pg. 135-136)

10. Stores in low-income neighborhoods tend to charge higher prices, in order to try to compensate or
higher costs and for slower rates of turnover in their inventory. What limits the ability of these stores to
completely compensate for these higher costs, so as to make the same rates of profits as stores in
higher-income neighborhoods? (pgs. 127–128)

### Productivity and Pay (Ch. 9)

1. What have been some of the economic and social consequences of the substitution of machine power
for human strength, as a result of industrialization, and the growing importance of knowledge, skills, and
experience in a high-tech economy? (pg. 222-223)

2. Would you expect the average hammer to drive more nails per year in a richer country or a poorer
country? Would you expect the average worker to produce more output per hour in a richer country or
poorer country? Explain the reasons in each case. (pgs. 230-231)

3. How can per capita income be increasing by 50 percent over a period of years, while average family
income and average household income remain almost stationary over those same years? (pgs. 217-218)

4. When the difference in income between the top and bottom brackets increases, does that necessarily
mean that a given set of individuals are falling further behind another given set of individuals? (pgs. 218-
220)

5. Although maximum wage laws existed long before minimum wage laws, only the latter are common
today. However, in those special cases where there have been maximum wage laws—as under wage
and price controls during World War II, for example, what effects would such laws have on the
allocation of scarce resources—and on discrimination against minorities and women? How would
maximum wage laws and minimum wage laws differ in their effects on discrimination? (pg. 229, 243-
244, 246, 249-251)

6. Does inequality of income tend to be greater or less in the long run than in the short run? Greater or
less than inequalities in consumption? Why do many statistics about “the rich” and “the poor” include
people who are neither rich nor poor in reality? (pgs. 213-215, 278-279)

7. A New York Times columnist once used per capita income statistics to judge the economic
performance of the administration of President Lyndon Johnson and, in later years, used household
income statistics to judge the economic performance of the administration of President Ronald Reagan.
Which set of statistics would tend to make the economic progress of the country look better and why?
(pgs. 217-218)

8. How can differences in the quality of transportation systems or in the level of corruption in different
countries affect the value of labor? (pg. 211-212)

9. Why is the productivity of an individual not the same as the efficiency of that individual? Give
examples comparing workers in Third World countries with workers in more prosperous countries and
comparing different baseball players in different kinds of situations. (pgs. 209–212)

10. It has often been said that, over time, a higher percentage of the nation’s total income goes to the
rich. In what sense is this true and in what sense is it not true? (pgs. 209–221)

11. What are the implications of the fact that most people today reach their peak earnings at later ages
than in generations past—and that these peak earnings are now usually a larger number of times
greater than the earnings of beginners than in times past? (pgs. 222-223)

### Myths about Markets & “Non-Economic Values (Ch. 23-24)

1. Costly safety devices or policies have often been defended on grounds that “if it saves just one life, it
is worth it.” What is the problem with that reasoning? (pgs. 612-614)

2. What are some of the reasons why different prices are changed for things that are physically
identical? (pgs. 568-570)

3. What is the point of having different brands of the same product if in fact all the brands are of pretty
much the same quality and sell for about the same price? What would happen in this situation if laws
did away with brands, so that each consumer could only identify what the product was, but not who
made it? (pgs. 573-578)

4. Explain how the presence or absence of the profit motive affects an organization’s likelihood of
achieving the purpose for which it was created, to the maximum extent possible with the resources at
its disposal. (pgs. 581-587)

5. What are the problems with the “trickle-down theory?” (pgs. 587-590)

6. Critics have claimed that profits exceed the value of the services performed by those who receive
those profits. What empirical evidence could be used to test this belief? (pg. 580-581, 586-587)

7. Can government-imposed prices for medical care reduce the costs of that care? (pgs. 570-571)

8. What is “predatory pricing” and what are the problems with it? (pgs. 571-573)

9. A government official in India said: “I don’t want multi-national companies getting rich selling face
cream to poor Indians.” What does that statement imply? (pg. 595-596)

10. Nobel Prizewinning economist F.A. Hayek said: “We shall not grow wiser before we learn that much
that we have done was very foolish.” What do you consider to be the three most foolish policies
discussed in this book? Would you have considered those policies foolish before reading Basic
Economics?
