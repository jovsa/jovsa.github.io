### Superficial Observation

### The Past Century

## 2. Productivity

* Productivity simple case: Let’s consider first a lone pioneer instead of a single employee of GM.
  * Case 1: He is producing things entirely for his own use. What he produces (ex. potatoes, etc...) is his wage. The only way he could double his wage would be to produce twice as much. This is like saying 1 = 1.
  * Case 2: Now if a neighbor moves in, the two pioneers might trade with each other some of what they produce. Hence, their wage would be some fraction of the total produced. If they both trade 1/2 of what they produce, this is like saying 1 + 1 = 2.
  * Case N: As society scales, the same would still be true. However, since not all people produce the same thing or the same amount or some work alone while other co-operate, things get a bit messy to model. However, the basic rule of productivity which is centered around production still holds true.

### Production comes first

### Wages Parallel Productivity

* There is no way by which arbitrary action or edict could have raised wages by as much as one per cent, unless it somehow increased production.
* Divergence between the two occur when there is an errors in the data, since they are expressions of the same thing as illustrated in the **Case 1** above.
* For larger economies (ex. USA), not all our national product goes for wage payments.
  * Roughly, about two-thirds of it goes for wages and salaries, with the remainder divided about equally between:
    1. Pay for current effort by those who are un-employed.
    2. Payment for the use of savings that have been invested in tools and equipment.

## 3. Dividing the Pie

* Higher wages come from increased output per hour of work. For how could consumption be greater than production?
  * Some persons work for themselves, using in full or in part tools provided from their own savings. And some persons work for others.
* The pie of personal incomes may be thought of as divided into two parts:
  1. One is the pay for work done currently.
  2. The other is pay for the use of savings — income from work done in the past and not used for consumption at that time.
* Some persons work for themselves, using in full or in part tools provided from their own savings. And some persons work for others. There are all sorts of combinations of income from these two sources.

### Present Divisions of the Pie

* In the early 1900's wage rates have risen with increased productivity at about 2.5 per cent a year. Thus in 6 years, the wage would equal 15% increase.
  * To put this in another way, productivity increases have raised wages perhaps 6 times as much as could possibly come from diverting to wages every cent of current returns for savings.
  * If the pie is fixed, wages can rise to at most 100% of that pie.

### Adverse Effects of Savings

* Capital created from savings make possible a part of our production. The average wage would be $200 to $250 (as opposed to $4600) if there were not tools. These tools are created from savings.
* This teamwork between those who save and those who use the tools is the reason for our high and rising wage rates.
* Among what we call “savings” are government bonds, which in reality are investments in a deficit of the government — not a productive tool any more than would be your tax receipt.
* Over the last quarter-century the costs of government have nearly trebled in proportion to personal incomes, going up from 12 to 34 per cent. Any increase in tax that is taken from corporate or personal will reduce savings and reduce the funding of tools for future use.

### History of an Idea

* An increased share of the pie going to wages, at the expense of the share for savings.
* No sane person is going to demand more wage from himself for his muscular work, at the expense of his management self or his tool-owning self.

### Slavery Was Tried

* Somewhere along man’s historic trail some men began to enslave others to work for them. In those early slave-holding days each person was able to produce little more than enough to keep himself from starving, and so a master couldn’t take much of what a slave produced or he would have a slave no more.
* In more recent times the voluntary employer-employee arrangement has largely displaced slavery throughout the world. Some work for others at a wage. They may want to do so as a way of gaining the use of tools with which to work, prestige involved or because for some other reason the wage offered is more enticing than the rewards in prospect while working for themselves.


### Labor and Surplus Value Theories

* The [labor theory of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value) is often used in one way or another in bargaining for wages, which are now a form of price and therefore the object of higgling and haggling in the market, as is the price of wheat or potatoes. The labor theory of value assumes that labor is the essential ingredient by which to measure all value.


### No Return on Capital

* Marx viewed return on capital in the same manner as a doctor views a parasite feasting on his patent. Hence, according to Marx:
  * Any share of the pie going to anyone other than the laborer, must be the result of a parasitical attachment by capitalists.
  * The capitalist owner who holds title to these material means of production can, in this way, claim ownership of the product. He can without parts of the profit as per his wish.
  * This is what he called [surplus value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value):the part of production which, under private ownership, is confiscated by the capitalist from its rightful owner, the laborer.

### Tools Make the Difference

* The [labor theory of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value) applies well in historic times when tools were simple. But today, our *tools* are much better and a big part of our value creation.
  * Of our total output, perhaps as much as 95% is because of the use of tools. And this is at a cost of only about 15 per cent of total output, as pay to those who have saved to create these tools. That, and not Marx’s concept, is the miracle that creates a surplus of value.

## 4. Tools to Harness Energy

* All life on earth is developed, sustained, and powered by energy from the sun. And that is the beginning of the story of how man has harnessed energy to improve his level of living.

### Conversation of Solar Energy

* Humans require a converter to change the sun’s energy into usable forms.
* All human food comes directly or indirectly from plants.
  * Plants are not, however, very efficient in doing this because about 10,000 units of the sun’s energy are required to produce and store ten units of energy in the grown plant.
  * Plans are in a sense, tools of mankind.

### Animal Power

* So back over time man has discovered how to use the energy from the sun, first in plant form as food and then, through plants, in the form of animals for food and for toil.
* Another early form of releasing plant-stored energy was the burning of wood, coal, oil and gas.
