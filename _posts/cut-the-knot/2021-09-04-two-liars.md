$$P(Truth) = \frac{1}{3}$$

$$P(Lie) = \frac{2}{3}$$

$$P(Truth) + P(Lie)= 1$$

A makes a statement, B confirms that statement. What is the probability that A is telling the truth?

Let $$P(E)$$ be the probability that B makes a statement and A confirms.

Hence,

$$P(E) = P(A_{truth} \cap  B_{truth}) + P(A_{lie} \cap B_{lie})$$

$$P(E) = \frac{1}{3}*\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}* \frac{2}{3}$$

$$P(E) = \frac{5}{9}$$

Let $$P(T)$$ be the probability that A is telling the truth.

Hence,

$$P(T|E) = \frac{P(T \cap E)}{P(E)}$$

Since,

$$P(T \cap E) = P(T) = \frac{1}{9}$$

$$P(T|E) = \frac{\frac{1}{9}}{\frac{5}{9}}$$

$$P(T|E) = \frac{1}{5}$$
