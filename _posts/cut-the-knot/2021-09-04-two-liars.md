$$P(Truth) = \frac{1}{3}$$
$$P(Lie) = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$P(Truth) + P(Lie)= 1$$

A makes a statement, B confirms that statement. What is the probability that A is telling the truth?

Let $$P(A)$$ be the probability that A is telling the truth.

$$1.0 = P(B_{truth}| A_{lie}) + P(B_{lie}| A_{truth})$$

$$P(B_{truth}| A_{lie}) = \frac{P(A_{lie} | B_{truth})}{A_{lie}}$$
