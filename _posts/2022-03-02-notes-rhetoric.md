### Rhetorical devices

1. Alliteration: The repetition of similar sounds at the beginning of words to create a rhythm or emphasize a point. Example: "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."

2. Anaphora: The repetition of a phrase at the beginning of successive sentences or clauses to create a sense of rhythm and emphasize a point. Example: "We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets..."

3. Antanagoge: The juxtaposition of two contrasting ideas to create a sense of balance. Example: "Sure, the car is expensive, but it's worth it in the long run."

4. Chiasmus: The repetition of similar phrases in reverse order to create a balance or emphasize a point. Example: "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."

5. Euphemism: The use of a mild or indirect word or phrase in place of one considered to be too harsh or blunt. Example: "He passed away" instead of "He died."

6. Hyperbaton: The rearrangement of the normal order of words to create an emphasis or unexpected effect. Example: "Into the water dove the boy" instead of "The boy dove into the water."

7. Hyperbole: The exaggeration of a statement for emphasis or effect. Example: "I've told you a million times to clean your room!"

8. Irony: The use of words to convey the opposite of their literal meaning, often for humorous or dramatic effect. Example: "Isn't it ironic that the only time I have free time is when I'm sick?"

9. Juxtaposition: The placement of two objects or ideas side by side to create a comparison or contrast. Example: "The beauty of the sunset was juxtaposed with the ugliness of the city skyline."

10. Litotes: The use of a double negative or understatement to create an effect of emphasis or affirmation. Example: "She's not the brightest bulb in the box."

11. Metaphor: The comparison of two dissimilar things to explain a concept or create an image. Example: "Life is a journey."

12. Onomatopoeia: The use of words that imitate sounds to create a vivid image or atmosphere. Example: "The bees buzzed around the flowers."

13. Oxymoron: The juxtaposition of two contradictory terms to create a paradoxical effect. Example: "Jumbo shrimp."

14. Paradox: A statement that appears to be self-contradictory but may in fact be true. Example: "This statement is false."

15. Personification: The attribution of human qualities to non-human things or ideas to create a vivid image or emphasize a point. Example: "The wind whispered through the trees."

16. Rhetorical question: A question asked for effect or emphasis, not for a genuine answer. Example: "Do you think I'm stupid?"

17. Simile: The comparison of two dissimilar things using the words “like” or “as” to explain a concept or create an image. Example: "She ran as fast as a cheetah."

18. Synecdoche: The use of a part to refer to the whole, or vice versa, to create a vivid image. Example: "All hands on deck" instead of "All sailors on deck."
