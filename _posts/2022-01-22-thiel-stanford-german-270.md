Course by: Russell Berman and Peter Thiel Tuesday 3:00 PM - 5:50PM

The current historical moment appears to be marked by opposition to globalization, which has  emerged in many countries in the various forms of populism, restrictive trade policies, attacks on  “neo-liberalism,” protest parties and localism. These positions are sometimes accompanied by  appeals to national interests and cultural traditions. This new mood is viewed as a break with a  previous paradigm of international institutions and “world citizenship.”

This seminar proceeds from this contemporary reassertion of state sovereignty against market  processes and internationalist claims in order to inquire into the historical, theoretical and cultural roots of the problem. Has the process of globalization stalled? What are the implications for the state and its aspiration for sovereignty? And how does technology, which contributed so much to the process of globalization, fit into this picture, especially in the guise of new technologies? This seminar therefore explores the tensions between state and market, their cultural contexts, technological innovation, and the importance of community belonging. Enrollment is limited: To be considered for enrollment in this course, please complete and submit the short application available at the Explore courses site by October 19, 2018, 11:59pm PST. Students accepted to participate in this course will be notified on October 26, 2018 by 6:00pm. Auditors are not permitted. Application: http://web.stanford.edu/—conorato/german270.fb


Course Requirements: In addition to completing all the reading and participating in discussion:

1) A two-page (approx. 500 words) reading response each week on the current texts. Do not provide summaries but instead offer your thoughts on how these texts contribute to our inquiry into globalization, sovereignty and technology. Feel free to highlight problematic or difficult passages.

2) Each student will present one 10-15 minute oral presentation on the day’s readings. There will be multiple presentations at each session, so the presenters will be expected to coordinate among themselves so as not to be repetitive. Introduce the readings, explain their importance and offer your criticism and discussion questions.

3) A term paper due at the last session, March 12. Discuss the topic in advance with the instructors. You may write on any of the texts, providing closer interpretation. However you are also welcome to discuss current political, technological or cultural developments—in light of the seminar’s reflections— and offer your account.


1 - Globalization: Prophecy versus History. January 8"

Francis Fukuyama, “The End of History?” in The National
Interest (1989) ~25pp

Kishore Mahbubani, Has the West Lost It? (2018) ~90pp
Stephen R. Platt, "How Britain's First Mission to China Went
Wrong" (2018) ~5 pp

Norman Angell, title chapter from The Great Illusion (first
published 1909; fourth American edition 1913) ~25pp

In the summer of 1989, just as tanks rolled through Tiananmen
Square, but just before the Berlin Wall fell, American political
scientist Francis Fukuyama declared the "end of history": different
countries might take more or less time to get there, but the
inevitable destination for everyone would be liberal democracy.
Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani reviews the historical
record of American leadership during this time of faith in
globalization: a failed war in Iraq, a disastrous financial crisis, and
a top trading partner that just declared its leader president for
life. Were prophecies of success related to this history of failure?
Norman Angell's Great Illusion (fourth American edition published
in 1913) and historian Stephen Platt's vignette of China before the
Opium War introduce two other moments, one and two centuries
ago, when leaders believed that global commerce would bring
about peace and unity.

2 - Universalism: From the Tower of Babel to the Last
Things... January 15"

Genesis 11:1-9 (The Tower of Babel) ~1p
Karl Lowith, Meaning in History (1949) pp iv-207 ~210pp
Revelation 17 (Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots) ~1p

Would anybody ever have believed in a single destiny for the
whole world without first having believed in a single deity?
Philosopher Karl L6with's Meaning in History gives an answer
while it reviews all the ways the West has understood history's
meaning, from the Bible to Kant and Marx.


3 - From 1914 to 1949: World War . . January
22"

Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political (1928; 1932
edition) ~100pp

Carl Schmitt, Land and Sea (1940) ~100pp

Alain de Benoist, "Nazism and Communism: Evil Twins?"

(1998) ~19pp

Carl Schmitt rebuts universal empire with a vision of friends
versus enemies. Alain de Benoist suggests that even the most
extreme enemies may come to resemble each other. How does a
geopolitical reading of land and sea powers map onto questions of
globalization, culture, and community?

4 - The 1950s: Toward a world state? . . January
29%

Alexandre Kojéve, Tyranny and Wisdom (1950) in On
Tyranny ~40pp

Leo Strauss, “Restatement on Xenophon’s Hiero” (1959) in

On Tyranny ~40pp

Why not have a world government? If there is a single rational
way to rule, why shouldn't rationality rule the world? Progressive
Russian-French emigré Alexandre Kojéve, who helped lay the
groundwork for the European Union, engages conservative
German-American emigré Leo Strauss in a classic debate about
the "universal and homogenous state."

5 - From the ‘60s to the ‘10s: Optimism to Stagnation
February 5"

Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, The American Challenge
(1967) pp 2-50 ~48pp

Robert Gordon, "Is U.S. Economic Growth Over?" (2012)
~21pp

John Horgan, "Why | Think Science Is Ending" (1997) ~10pp

M. Teitelbaum, "The Myth of the Science and Engineering
Shortage" (2014) ~5pp

Christopher Lasch, The Revolt of the Elites (1996) pp 3-79;
pp 161-175 ~90pp

Vaclav Smil, "Can Trump bring manufacturing jobs back?"
(2017) ~2pp

Proponents of progress promise(d) economic growth and
technological innovation. Yet authors this week suggest that
progress may have been oversold. Journalist Jean-Jacques
Servan-Schreiber in 1967 warned his fellow Europeans of coming
eclipse as a result of accelerating economic and technological
progress in America. But economist Robert Gordon, looking back
from 2012, reviews an actual record of economic and
technological stagnation. John Horgan argues that pure science,
too, has reached a plateau. Michael Teitelbaum suggests that
alarmism about a shortage of scientists has perversely made
science a less attractive career. The gap between the mirage of
progress and the reality of stagnation—experienced unequally
across the social spectrum—has had cultural and political
consequences, as described by Christopher Lasch. Vaclav Smil
raises a politically relevant point about the unique importance of
manufacturing.

6 - Varieties of Universalism and Cosmopolitanism
February 12*

Ingeborg Bachmann, "Three Paths to the Lake" (1972) ~95pp
Benedict XVI, the Regensburg Lecture (2006) ~20pp
Barack Obama, the Cairo Speech (2009) ~13pp

Civilization”
(2016) ~10pp
J. D. Davidson & Lord William Rees-Mogg, "Transcending
Locality"
(1997) ~29pp
Kai-fu Lee, Al Superpowers (2018) ~100pp excerpt TBD

Austrian author Ingeborg Bachmann's story explores the
subjective experience of a cosmopolitan life, amid questions of
empire and the authenticity of provincial localism. Benedict XVI
and Barack Obama both address Islam, one from the point of view
of rationalist Catholic universalism, the other from the point of
view of liberal humanitarian universalism. K. A. Appiah argues for
cosmopolitanism and against ideas of Western uniqueness. But if,
as he claims, there is “no such thing as Western Civilization,”
would he also claim that there is no East Asian civilization? No
Islamic civilization? Is civilization antithetical to any local
specification? James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg
could be said to herald a different kind of cosmopolitanism, one
based on the separation of money from government. Their view of
technology transcending politics raises the question of
cryptocurrency: is this the ultimate challenge to state
sovereignty? At the opposite end of information technology, Kai-fu
Lee predicts that the implementation of Artificial Intelligence will
be the key to China's coming economic dominance.

7 - The Future of World Order... February 19%

Yoram Hazony, The Virtue of Nationalism (2018) ~234 pp
Liu Mingfu, "The Chinese Dream to Overtake America"
(2015) ~5pp

Garden variety progressivism stereotypically denounces empire
and imperialism, but what is the opposite of empire? Yoram
Hazony says it is nationalism, for which he offers a sustained
defense. Former PLA officer Liu Mingfu speaks for one particularly
strong strain of contemporary nationalism.

8 - Actually existing globalization: Corruption on the
periphery. February 26"

Sarah Chayes, Thieves of State (2015) ~200pp
Rory Stewart, "The Irresistible Illusion" in London Review of
Books (2009) ~9pp

Based on long experience in US-occupied Afghanistan, Sarah
Chayes argues that corruption fuels violence. But who will take
responsibility for ridding the world of corruption, and how could it
be done? Rory Stewart contrasts the realism of 19th century
British imperialists with the abstraction and impracticality of
contemporary bureaucrats. This week looks at what has actually
happened where Western force has been used to spread
democracy.

9 - Actually existing globalization: Consumption in the
metropole___ March 5**

Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, "Conspicuous consumption is over"

(2017) ~2pp

Amy Chua, "Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior" (2011) ~5pp

Tom Wright & Bradley Hope, "The Billion-Dollar Mystery Man

and the Wildest Party Vegas Ever Saw" (2018) ~10pp

René Girard, “Triangular Desire,” from Deceit, Desire, and
the Novel

(1961) ~50pp
Geoffrey West, "Toward a Science of Cities," from Scale
(2017) ~65pp

Is there any future outside of big cities? What are big cities for,
anyway? This week turns to questions of imitation and rivalry ona
global scale, especially as intensified within and diffused from
metropoles like London and New York. Elizabeth Currid-Halkett
describes the consumption habits of the upper middle class; Amy
Chua describes the methods of child rearing intended to get kids
into that class. Tom Wright and Bradley Hope's reporting on the
man who stole $7 billion USD from the 1MDB sovereign wealth
fund combines imitative consumption with the previous week's
theme of corruption. René Girard contributes a theory of imitative
desire; Geoffrey West outlines a theory of cities. Is the
concentration of talent in a small handful of cities irreversible?
