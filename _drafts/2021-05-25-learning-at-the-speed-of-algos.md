## Notes
* Types of learning
  * Type 1: Ford: Some advantage in process as you increase the number of outputs (by some doubling)
  * Type 2: Apple (Every new product allows you to build a newer product that's better)
  * Type 3: Algos
    * Is this the next itertion of the Zara model?
    * Maybe a linear combination of the above two?

* Table stakes or competitive advantage?

* What are the dynamics?
  * Seems to be following software + service laws.
    * Is it no-op if you can't set the service part of the
  * As you grow:
    * More data (costs increase)
    * Model training costs increase
    * Great scaling by demographic
  * Can you use 7 powers processing power modelling to figure out a general policy and some conditions?
    * Why we would need simulators?
