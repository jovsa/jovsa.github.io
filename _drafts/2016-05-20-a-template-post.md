## The essay

> The first 15 seconds should immediately reinforce the value proposition that was promised in the title + thumbnail. We no longer want an extended 'welcome back to the channel my name is ali i'm a junior doctor working in cambridge blah blah'. We need a snappy hook that tells people "this video will deliver on what I was promised". This is arguably the most important part of the video.
> "Hey friends welcome back to the channel. Today we're talking about abc" is the longest that the intro should be. In an ideal world, we'd design a hook that doesn't even have a 'welcome back to the channel', it just launches straight into delivering value.

**Intro**

**Value (aiming for 50% retention by the end)**

**Point to a custom playlist / video**
> The objective of the ending is to keep them watching by pointing them to a custom playlist of 3-4 other videos that they might be interested in. Eg: "if you liked this video you'll love this custom playlist i've made for you that has my most popular videos about how to study that have apparently changed people's lives. Thanks for watching, and see you later".
