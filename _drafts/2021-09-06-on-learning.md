I went to school in Toronto, Canada. At the university, students used to maintain a repository of past exams.
Given I did engineering, most classes had a heavy practical component (problem sets, assignments, term projects). Most of these took a long time to do especially if you were new to the subject. As a "hack" people used to rely on the past exams to guide their learning. In the short term, this was a good thing since you got better grades in the exams. In the long term, this was one of the worse things you could do for your learning.


When you use past exams to "hack" the learning process:
* You don't learn how to apply the material. You just learn to answer the exam.
* You don't learn how to learn.

How do you learn a new things that you can apply? A new skill that will give you an alpha over others?

There are usually two routes:

the first is to memorize imperfect verbs, grammatical rules, future vs. past tenses, recite boring context-free sentences, and pass an exam. This is good when you get a binary outcome of pass/fail and you don't have to worry about it after that.

The second approach consists in going to a bar, struggling a little bit and, out of the need to blend-in and integrate with a fun group of people, then suddenly find yourself able to communicate. In other words, by playing, by being alive as a human being.

I personally have never seen anyone learn to speak a language properly by the first route. Also, I have never seen anyone fail to do so by the second one.
The negative of the second, it takes time.

What do we get with this time?
There are detials in the process that our brain needs to grasp that we can only get through iterating and reacting with it over time.

People who game the system: They have the first kinda of knowledge (they can talk about the the buzz, but they have no alpha).


Knowlege we get via tinkering is vastly grater than the knolwledge we get from reasoning.
